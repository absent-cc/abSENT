# ðŸ‘‹ Say Goodbye To Schoology Lists!

Welcome to abSENT! We're a Mobile App + API Backend that notifies Newton students when their teachers are absent. 

Long gone are the mornings of scrolling through schoology, praying that your teacher is absent, only to miss their name in a sea of absent teachers. Long gone are the times when you walk into your class, only to realize that your teacher is absent.

With abSENT, these days are, well...*absent*.

# ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
We got sick of having to check Schoology. The mobile interface is non-existent, the lists do not load on data (or even school wifi!), and squinting to find your teacher in a list of 25 is just painful.

Thus, abSENT was born.
