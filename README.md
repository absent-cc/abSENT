# ðŸ‘‹ Say Goodbye To Schoology Lists!

Welcome to abSENT! We're a mobile app that notifies Newton Public Schools students when their teachers are absent.

Long gone are the mornings of scrolling through Schoology, praying that your teacher is absent, only to miss their name in a sea of absent teachers. Long gone are the times when you walk into your class, only to realize that your teacher is absent.

With abSENT, these days are, well...*absent*.

# ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
We got sick of having to check Schoology. The mobile interface is non-existent, the lists do not load on data (or even school wifi!), and squinting to find your teacher in a list of 25 is just painful.

Thus, abSENT was born.

# ðŸ’½ Features
- Works at both North and South!
- Daily push notifications for your absent teachers.
- Customizability! Don't want another notification every morning but still want to see your teachers? No problem!
- Easy to use interface.
- Multi-teacher class support -> Get notified about assistant teachers too!
- Extra teachers -> Get notifications when extracurricular teachers and coaches are absent too, not just your classes.
- Secure login with your NPS Google account.
- Your data is safe!
    - Personal data can only be accessed by you!
    - Delete your account at any time and we'll wipe your data. No hard feelings.

***All this, and its COMPLETELY FREE!***
